# Changelog

## 0.1.0 (September 11, 2012)

### Engine

hackers now use [ranviermud](http://www.ranviermud.com/) as MUD engine.
That brings a lot of new features :

+ rooms, items, npcs can be created on the fly with YAML files
+ server **hotbooting** with an 'hotboot' command	
+ **advanced scripting** of **game objects** with *commands* and *events* using a pretty decent language : Javascript, for sure !
+ **multilingual** support (currently English and French supported, trads are welcome)
+ client **chat** (*general*) and **say** (*local*) commands supported

Thanks to the author, the engine seems well-designed :)

### Game

+ new ascii logo for hackers
